This code only works if you add passwordManager.py to a folder and then open the folder
in VScode or another editor. Otherwise passwords.txt and the key won't be created.  

The file also has a method which generates a key which has been commented out but needs to be 
uncommented to make a new key on a new system. There is also the method below to load the key
once it has been created. This key will eventually be used to create a master password which 
will be needed to run the code fully.
